# egypt_has_fallen

A [Glest](https://github.com/Glest) network scenario

An evil faction, known only as "Magic" has invaded and destroyed most
of Egypt's kingdom. In a futile attempt to fight off Magic's army,
Egypt has sent her last remaining soldiers to stop them. If they are
not successful, you will be Egypt's only chance at survival. You must
protect her until she's strong enough to fight back and to assist you
in vanquishing the Magic faction. If you are successful, Queen
Cleopatra will figure out some way to repay her debt to you...

### Factions:

Team 1 - Persian (Human), Norsemen (Human), Indian (Human), Egypt (CPU Mega 2.5)<br />
Team 2 - Magic 4 CPU (Mega 2.5)
